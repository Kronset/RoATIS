# About
RoATIS was created to make life easier for Roblox air traffic controllers! The program is currently in BETA version and provides only basic functions such as generating ATIS based on the provided data. However, it will be developed further and will include features such as detecting ICAO from a given game on Roblox, which will automatically add radio frequencies and runway numbers, as well as saving airport profiles.
